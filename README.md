This project shows a webpage all about me. It also displays my current skills in html, css, and learning to host on Render. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for header, .layout, .divider, ul, img, and footer. Added center alignment and bigger font for the header, flex wrapping for the layout class, inline-block styling and box shadows for the divider class, columns for the ul class, constant height for each image, and a top margin for the footer. 
- **Add JavaScript Animation**: Add an animation to image such that the images appear larger when clicked on and revert to original size when the cursor moves off of the image
-**Semantic Tags**: Experimented with header, footer, img, a, and section tags. Placed the title off the page in the header, credits in the footer, two images for each of my hobbies (robotics and table tennis), a link to my LinkedIn profile, and the section tag to separate each component of information on the page. 

## Design Achievements
- **Created and Used Color Palette**: Incorporated all six colors from the color palette onto the webpage using their respective hex values. Styled for each using classnames and tags. The image of the color wheel is located in colorwheel.JPG
- **Used the Roboto Flex Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto Flex as the font for the primary copy text in my site
